## 大家好啊，这是我发在GITHUB上的第一个项目，若有错误请多多多多。。。包含，哈哈哈
## Hello everyone, this is the first project I posted on GITHUB. If there are any mistakes, please feel free to advise me ... hahaha

## 这个项目也不复杂，就是根据用KPCA方法提取高维时间序列的特征，再把他们输入LSTM神经网络里，从而提高模型预测的精度与速度。
## This project is not complicated either. It is based on using the KPCA method to extract the features of high-dimensional time series and then input them into the LSTM neural network, thereby improving the accuracy and speed of model prediction.

## PCA过程如下所示：
## The PCA process is as follows:

## LSTM结构就是这样：
## This is the LSTM structure:

## 总之，我在PCA-LSTM-PREDICTION.ipynb文件里写的很清楚了，欢迎指教
## In short, I have written it clearly in the PCA-LSTM-PREDICTION.ipynb file, and welcome for your advice.
